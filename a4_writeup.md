# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part would probably be how to know if someone has one. It is just the most time consuming as you have to manually input all possible win conditions. 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would include a random or preset if statements after the layer has made a move. Once the play has made a move it would return the board once with the player's choice then the bots choice returning a second board. Random would allow the bot to play agains the human. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
Because Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game with my current knowledge I would most likely just use preset if statemnets replcating the perfect play possible in the game. tictactoe is a solved game so the most optimal routes are already determined. However since this is an AI class I would be curious if I would be able to allow the computer to "learn" how to play itself.
